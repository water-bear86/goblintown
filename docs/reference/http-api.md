# HTTP API

The browser UI uses the same local HTTP surface exposed by `goblintown serve`.
Most endpoints are local-first and write to `.goblintown/`.

## Streaming Notes

`/api/rite/:runId/stream` emits history first, then `replay-end`, then live
events. Browser clients should handle both replayed and live events. If a server
restart interrupts a run, the persisted run record marks that state instead of
pretending the run completed.
